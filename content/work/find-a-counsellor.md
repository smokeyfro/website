I was approached by Chris and Bernice after they saw my work on HeadwayRocket. Both are counsellors by profession and they felt there was a need for an easier way to find counsellors in your area.

The first version of the site was focussed around the counsellor profiles and search. The project was put on hold due to other commitments.

The design was created in Adobe Fireworks.
The site was built on WordPress, using Headway and Types and Views.
The search was improved using SearchWP.
