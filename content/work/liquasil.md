I was hired by David Carter to give the Liquasil site a fresh lick of paint (pardon the pun) on a shiny new (mostly plugin free) install. Once the design was settled (and logo refreshed) I moved on to creating a custom child-theme for the Beans theme framework and a custom site plugin to house all the sites custom functionality not related to the design.

I used the site plugin to register the various post types, taxonomies, custom field assignment and WordPress admin clean up. The child-theme was used to define the various page templates, theme fragments and cherry pick which UIkit components were used on any given page. Yoast SEO was used to handle all the front-end meta, content evaluation and social sharing.

Each of the custom post type lists and edit screens were customised to only show fields relevant to the specific task.

The end result was a clean, uniform design which puts emphasis on the content. The overall performance was massively improved, as was the mobile experience.
