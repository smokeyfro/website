A project that is close to my heart, which I have worked on for just over a year. Our strategy is to establish a cooperative of small-scale producers, each focussing on what is best suited to their unique land, wildlife and other factors. 

In addition to this, we're creating multiple avenues for local producers to sell their goods, which include an online marketplace, multiple retail outlets and representation via shared market stalls across the Garden Route.

To keep the delivery cost as low as possible, we're recruiting a network of collection points (12 so far and counting), where producers can drop off their orders.

## Multi seller marketplace

The EdenHub Marketplace is an extension of the EdenHub project, which is an NGO myself and a friend started when we realised the fragility of our food systems. The project aims to support local producers, by helping them farm more productively, while giving them an avenue to sell their produce online with as little friction (and costs) as possible. 

For the initial setup, I opted to use WordPress, along with WooCommerce and Dokan Multi-vendor marketplace plugin to get a mvp up as quickly as possible. 

I've overriden pretty much all the front-end layouts using template overrides and any available action hooks. I also completely overhauled the vendor dashboard
