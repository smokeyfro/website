The EdenHub Marketplace is an extension of the EdenHub project, which is an NGO myself and a friend started when we realised the fragility of our food systems. The project aims to support local producers, by helping them farm more productively, while giving them an avenue to sell their produce online with as little friction (and costs) as possible. 

For the initial setup, I opted to use WordPress, along with WooCommerce and Dokan Multi-vendor marketplace plugin to get a mvp up as quickly as possible. 

I've overriden pretty much all the front-end layouts using template overrides and any available action hooks. I also completely overhauled the vendor dashboard
