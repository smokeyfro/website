The backpackers guide to South Africa that didn't exist, so I created it. I've been planning the project for over two years, but only recently started on the development.

As a digital nomad and backpacker, I was frustrated that no sites existed that provided up-to-date information about hostels, possible road trip routes, information about the different towns and cities that make up South Africa.
