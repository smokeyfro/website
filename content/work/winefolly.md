I was initially contracted to redesign and rebuild the previous WineFolly.com site, but was later hired full-time as the sole developer working on the site.

The site was built using the Beans framework and Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project, which aims to set a new standard for the performance of websites on mobile devices. 

Some of the other projects I worked on include:

- A suite of Gutenberg blocks.
- An index of 260+ grape and wine landing pages.
- AB Testing using Google Optimise
- Custom shortcodes, including a super flexible card shortcode.
- A custom shortcode preset builder.
- Native integration with Klaviyo.
- Feedback system for posts.
- Custom post type for team and contributors.
- Custom landing pages for different initiatives.
- Custom API endpoints for the AMP integration.
