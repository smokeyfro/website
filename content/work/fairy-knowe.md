While the previous site worked well for the previous owner, the new owners were keen to embrace a more modern stack. I ended up using GraphCMS as the backend along with Gridsome to take advantage of their static generation, optimisation and plugin architecture.

I created content types for the accommodation, photo gallery and normal contnet pages.
