excerpt: I'm a huge fan of Directus, an open-source headless content management system - which covers everything you'd want in a cms. I've used it to create an online-learning app, a gardening app, as a page builder for local clients site. It's incredibly versatile and provides so much out-the-box and is easy to extend, but I'll cover that further in.
