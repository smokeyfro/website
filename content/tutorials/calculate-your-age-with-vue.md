excerpt: "Yesterday I finally started updating my new portfolio content and when I got to the about page on my old site, I noticed my age was still set to 35. Whoops."

This is partly due to me spreading myself too thin and part of the motivation behind pulling all my side projects under a single roof.

While it's easy to remedy (just set a reminder to update the dang age man!), a better solution would be to have the age value update automatically. Similarly to how one would auto update the copyright date in a sites footer.

Doing this is in php would be pretty trivial, but being that it's not something I've done before in Vue.js, it took a bit of tinkering to get working.

I'm using Gridsome for my site, but this will apply to any Vue.js project. Here is the snippet, added as computed properties:

```ts
<script>
    export default {
      computed:{
        calculateAge: function() {
          let currentDate = new Date();
          let birthDate = new Date("1980/12/31");
          let difference = currentDate - birthDate;
          let age = Math.floor(difference/31557600000);
          return age
        }
      }
    }
</script>
```
For my site I used the same principle to automatically calculate the number of years I've been working on the web.

Here is the updated version:

```ts
<script>
    export default {
      computed:{
        calculateAge: function() {
          let currentDate = new Date();
          let birthDate = new Date("1980/12/31");
          let difference = currentDate - birthDate;
          let age = Math.floor(difference/31557600000);
          return age
        },
        calculateExperience: function() {
          let currentDate = new Date();
          let startDate = new Date("2001/02/01");
          let difference = currentDate - startDate;
          let experience = Math.floor(difference/31557600000);
          return experience
        }
      }
    }
</script>
```
I could probably simplify this into a single re-usable function, but it does the trick for now. I'll likely cover that in a later post when I start to refactor all of my code. 

Now that the methods are setup, we can output the values in our template using:

```html
<p>I've lived on planet earth for {{ calculateAge }} years and have worked on the web for {{ calculateExperience }} of them.</p>
```

Which outputs as:

*I've lived on planet earth for 38 years and have worked on the web for 18 of them.*

Just another example of how Vue.js makes implementing your ideas that much easier. I should also add that I realise this is trivial to do in vanilla js or jQuery, but that is not really the point. I'm simply sharing neat tricks as I figure them out, in the hopes that they might help someone else down the line.

Until next time,
