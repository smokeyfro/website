skills:
  - title: Web / UI Design
    description: As I designer I get excited about clean, minimalistic design that is functional and centered around the person using it.
  - title: Front-end Development
    description: As a developer I'm obsessed with performance and building interfaces that are a pleasure to use. Tabs over spaces.
  - title: Theme Development
    description: I craft themes that are purpose-driven, minimal in design, easy to customise and highly optimised for mobile and performance.
  - title: Product Management
    description: As a product manager I thrive on building and iterating on products, coming up with growth hacks and getting the product to market.

coding:
  - title: HTML/CSS
    description: I'd never call myself an expert at anything, but I've been teaching myself html/css for over 18 years and feel I have a pretty good grasp an the nuances of the languages.
  - title: PHP
    description: I've been writing PHP for close on ten years and while I'd definitely not classify myself an expert, I have a pretty solid understanding of variables, loops, funtions, classes and CMS specific implementations, such as WordPress.
  - title: JavaScript
    description: Like most developers who have been around for a while, I started off by using jQuery and generally am able to implement most of my ideas. These days I'm leaning more towards vanilla JavaScript and Vue.js.
  - title: Git
    description: I use git to version control my code and these days tend to use Github as my platform of choice. I'll eventually get around to setting up my own instance of GitLab.
