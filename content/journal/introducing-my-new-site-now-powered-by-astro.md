description: In the tradition of keeping up with the times, I finally got around to migrating my personal site (and playground) from Gridsome to Nuxt. It's gone surprisingly smooth and overall a slightly more polished experience.

I will of course continue to polish, refine and optimize, but now thanks to a complete engine overall and shiny new lick of paint, I'm happy with my progress so far.
