excerpt: An independent designer, front-end developer, and entrepreneur, working remotely from my farm in the Garden Route of South Africa.

This is my home on the web where I showcase my [work](/work "View a selection of my work"), share my [themes](/themes "Share my open-source themes"), write web-dev [tutorials](/tutorials "Write technical tutorials") and post updates via my [journal](/journal "Share updates of what I'm working on via my journal").

As a designer who codes, I'm able to take an idea from conception to finished product and have helped clients of all sizes bring their ideas to life.
